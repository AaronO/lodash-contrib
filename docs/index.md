# lodash-contrib

> The brass buckles on lodash's utility belt - a contributors' library for [lodash](http://lodashjs.org/).

## Introduction

### Places

  * [Documentation](http://documentcloud.github.io/lodash-contrib/)
  * [Source repository](https://github.com/documentcloud/lodash-contrib)
  * [Tickets and bug reports](https://github.com/documentcloud/lodash-contrib/issues?state=open)
  * [Maintainer's website](http://www.fogus.me)

### Why lodash-contrib?

While lodash provides a bevy of useful tools to support functional programming in JavaScript, it can't
(and shouldn't) be everything to everyone. lodash-contrib is intended as a home for functions that, for
various reasons, don't belong in lodash proper. In particular, it aims to be:

  * a home for functions that are limited in scope, but solve certain point problems, and
  * a proving ground for features that belong in lodash proper, but need some advocacy and/or evolution
(or devolution) to get them there.

### Use

First, youâ€™ll need lodash. Then you can grab the relevant lodash-contrib libraries and simply add
something
like the following to your pages:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="lodash.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="lodash.object.builders.js"></script>

At the moment there are no cross-contrib dependencies (i.e. each library can stand by itself), but that may
change in the future.
